        <br><h2 align="center">8 Foods You Should Never Eat More Of (About Children)</h2><br>
            <ol>
                <li>The orange:</li>
                    <p>Although oranges are nutritious, they do contain lutein. If you eat too many oranges, it can lead to "lutein skin disease", abdominal pain and diarrheal, and even bone problems. Therefore, the maximum number of oranges a child can eat per day is four medium oranges.</p>
                <li>Lentils:</li>
                    <p>Lentils contain a specific gene that causes goitre in humans and promotes the excretion of thyroxine, resulting in thyroxine deficiency. When thyroxine is deficient, the body automatically increases thyroid production. Children at this stage of development are very fragile and should not eat too many lentils.</p>
                <li>Spinach:</li>
                    <p>Spinach is rich in oxalic acid, which produces calcium oxalate and zinc oxalate, two kinds of salts that are difficult for the human body to absorb, so they are easily eliminated by the body. Calcium and zinc are needed in large quantities during a child's development, and a lack of these two elements is bad for the development of bones and teeth, as well as mental development of the baby.</p>
                <li>Eggs:</li>
                    <p>Eggs contain a variety of nutrients, but if you eat too many eggs, you will take in too much protein, which is easy to lead to overnutrition, and then lead to obesity. In addition, protein is difficult to digest, so eating too many eggs can increase the burden on the stomach, liver and kidneys, and in severe cases, may cause these internal organs to malfunction. Therefore, children should not eat more than three eggs a day.</p>
                <li>Sunflower seeds:</li>
                    <p>Sunflower seeds contain a type of unsaturated fat. If your baby eats too many sunflower seeds, their body will need to consume large amounts of vitamin B to digest these unsaturated fats. Vitamin B, however, can disrupt the functioning of liver cells, or lead to dehydration.</p>
                <li>Ginseng:</li>
                    <p>There are many ginseng by-products in the market, such as: ginseng soup, ginseng milk, ginseng cream, ginseng biscuits, ginseng jelly and so on. Ginseng can promote the secretion of human sex hormones. If the baby eats too much ginseng, it will lead to excessive secretion of sex hormones, which will lead to premature puberty or other abnormal body shape development.</p>
                <li>Salt:</li>
                    <p>Children should not eat more than 5 grams of salt a day. If children eat too much salt, it is likely to cause high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, brain cancer and so on.</p>
                <li>Saccharin:</li>
                    <p>Saccharin is now added to children's sweets and drinks. Studies have shown that eating too much saccharin can cause diseases of blood vessels, heart, lungs, peripheral nerves, and affect the functions of the stomach, liver, bronchus, bladder and other organs.</p>
